A hash table in C# is a data structure that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. It utilizes a hash function to map keys to specific locations (buckets) within an underlying array. The hash function computes a unique hash code for each key, enabling quick access to the corresponding bucket. Collisions may occur when multiple keys hash to the same location, requiring additional handling, such as chaining or open addressing, to store multiple values in the same bucket. Hash tables offer fast average-case time complexity for key-based operations like insertion, retrieval, and deletion, making them a fundamental tool for efficient data storage and retrieval in C# applications.
