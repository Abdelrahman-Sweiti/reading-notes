Readings and How to Read Technical Documentation:
Understanding how to read technical documentation is crucial for developers. It involves systematically going through written materials, often provided by software or hardware vendors, to grasp the functionalities, features, and usage of a product or technology. Techniques include skimming for overviews, focusing on relevant sections, understanding syntax, and utilizing examples to enhance comprehension.

How Credit Card Processing Works:
Credit card processing involves a series of steps to authorize and complete a transaction. When a customer makes a purchase, their credit card details are securely transmitted to the payment gateway, which validates the information, checks for funds, and communicates with the issuing bank for approval. Once approved, the transaction is completed, and funds are transferred to the merchant account.

How ONLINE Credit Card Processing Works:
Online credit card processing is similar to traditional processing but conducted over the internet. When a customer submits their credit card information on a website, it's encrypted and sent to the payment gateway. The gateway then follows the steps of authorization and transaction completion, ensuring security and reliability in the online transaction process.
