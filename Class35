after reading the given article about graphs i made a short summary about it , 

A graph is a mathematical and computational representation of a collection of interconnected nodes or vertices, where connections between nodes are represented by edges. Graphs are used to model various real-world relationships and structures, making them a fundamental data structure in computer science and applied mathematics. Graphs can be directed (edges have a specific direction) or undirected (edges have no direction), and they can be cyclic (contain cycles) or acyclic (do not contain cycles). Graphs are used in a wide range of applications, including social networks, transportation networks, recommendation systems, routing algorithms, and much more. The study of graphs and their properties is known as graph theory.
