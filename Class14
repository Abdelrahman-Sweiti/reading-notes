Summary : 
Routing within MVC:
Routing within Model-View-Controller (MVC) refers to the process of handling incoming web requests and mapping them to appropriate controller actions. In the MVC architecture, 
routing plays a crucial role in determining how URLs are interpreted and processed. When a user makes a request to a specific URL, 
the routing system analyzes the URL and decides which controller and action method should be invoked to generate the appropriate response. 
Properly configured routing is essential for building organized and SEO-friendly web applications, as it helps maintain clean and meaningful URLs while ensuring the correct execution of actions based on the requested resource.

Routing within Core:
Routing within Core pertains to the routing mechanism employed in the ASP.NET Core framework. ASP.NET Core 
is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern web applications.
Routing in ASP.NET Core follows a similar concept as in MVC, but it comes with additional features and flexibility to cater to the requirements of various application types. 
ASP.NET Core's routing system allows developers to define routes using attributes, conventions, or a combination of both. This approach enables clean and concise route configurations and enhances the overall development experience.
With ASP.NET Core's routing, developers can easily handle complex URL patterns, customize route parameters, and create RESTful APIs efficiently.
