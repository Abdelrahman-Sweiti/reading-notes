API testing is the process of evaluating and verifying the functionality, reliability, performance, 
and security of an application programming interface (API). It involves sending different types of requests to the API endpoints and checking the responses to ensure that they meet the expected behavior and comply with the API specifications. 
API testing is crucial for identifying bugs, ensuring interoperability, and maintaining the overall quality of the API. Automated API testing frameworks and tools, such as Postman, RestAssured, or NUnit,
are often used to streamline the testing process and facilitate continuous integration and deployment.

Swagger, now known as OpenAPI Specification (OAS), is an open-source framework for describing, documenting, and visualizing RESTful APIs. 
It provides a standardized way to define API endpoints, request and response payloads, parameters, and authentication methods. Swagger allows developers to create human-readable documentation for APIs, making it easier for other developers to understand and use the API. Moreover, it enables the automatic generation of client SDKs and server stubs based on the API definition.
By using Swagger, teams can ensure consistency and accuracy in API documentation, leading to better collaboration and faster development.

Controllers testing, also known as API endpoint testing or web API testing, focuses on verifying the behavior and functionality of controllers in a web application. Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and manage the flow of data between the client and the server. Controllers testing involves sending mock or actual HTTP requests to the API endpoints implemented in the controllers and evaluating the responses to ensure they align with the expected behavior and business logic. Mocking frameworks and unit testing frameworks like xUnit, NUnit, or Jest are commonly used to write and execute tests for controllers. 
Proper controllers testing is essential to ensure that the API endpoints work as intended, handle errors gracefully, and provide the expected data or status codes to clients.
