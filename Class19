Claims-Based Authentication is a method of user verification in computer systems, where a user's identity is established through a set of claims or attributes rather than just a simple username and password. These claims represent various pieces of information about the user, such as roles, permissions, and personal details. By relying on these claims, systems can make access decisions and tailor user experiences based on the provided information. This approach enhances security and flexibility, as it allows for fine-grained control over user access and reduces the need for storing sensitive information centrally.

Claims, in the context of security and authentication, are pieces of information that provide details about a user. These details might include user roles, permissions, personal attributes, and other relevant data. Unlike traditional authentication systems that only establish a user's identity through a username and password, claims provide a more nuanced and versatile way to verify users. Claims are used in claims-based authentication methods to make access control decisions, allowing systems to adapt to different user contexts and requirements.

JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication is a widely used method for securing web applications and APIs. It involves generating a digitally signed token in JSON format that contains claims about a user. This token is issued by an authentication server upon successful user login and is then sent with each subsequent request to the application or API. The token's payload contains information like user ID, roles, and expiration time. JWTs are self-contained and do not require server-side storage, which makes them efficient and suitable for stateless applications. They are also commonly used in single sign-on (SSO) scenarios, enhancing security and simplifying user authentication processes.
