Collections refer to data structures that allow you to store, retrieve, and manipulate multiple values. They provide various ways to group similar items together
, such as arrays, lists, dictionaries, and queues. Each collection type has unique characteristics and methods tailored to specific use cases. For example, arrays have a fixed size, while lists can dynamically grow or shrink.

Enumerations, often referred to as enums, are special types that define a set of named constants. 
Enums allow you to assign meaningful names to a set of related values, making the code more readable and maintainable. Enums are commonly used to represent options, states, or categories with a finite number of choices. For instance,
you might define an enum named "Color" with values like Red, Green, and Blue.
