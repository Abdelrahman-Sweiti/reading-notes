Razor Pages is a feature in ASP.NET Core that simplifies web development by combining HTML markup and server-side code within a single file. It follows a page-focused programming model, allowing developers to create dynamic web pages using Razor syntax. This approach streamlines the development process, making it easier to build and maintain server-rendered web UIs with minimal configuration and a clear separation of concerns.
