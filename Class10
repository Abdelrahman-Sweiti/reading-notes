What is a stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
It can be visualized as a stack of plates where the last plate added is the first one to be removed.
Key operations on stacks:
a. Push: Adding an item to the top of the stack.
b. Pop: Removing the topmost item from the stack.
c. Peek: Viewing the topmost item without removing it.

Implementation of a stack:

Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
When using an array, we keep track of the topmost element using a variable.
With linked lists, we add and remove elements at the head of the list.
