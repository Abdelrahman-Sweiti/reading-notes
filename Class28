Authentication :

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically by validating their credentials (e.g., username and password).
 authentication can be implemented using various schemes, including cookie-based, token-based, or external authentication providers (e.g., OAuth, OpenID Connect).
ASP.NET Core provides a flexible and extensible authentication system that allows you to configure different authentication mechanisms for your web applications.

Authorization:

Authorization defines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access after they have been authenticated.
In ASP.NET Core, authorization can be implemented using policies, roles, or claims to specify permissions for different parts of your application.
The [Authorize] attribute is commonly used to restrict access to specific controllers or actions based on authorization rules.
HTTP Cookies:

HTTP cookies are small pieces of data sent by a web server to a user's browser and stored locally on the user's machine.
Cookies are often used for session management, user tracking, and storing user preferences.
